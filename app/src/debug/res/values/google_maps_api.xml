    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    EC:BB:A0:85:C1:B7:13:FE:3D:91:12:C1:FF:C6:68:00:29:4A:4E:8D

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    EC:BB:A0:85:C1:B7:13:FE:3D:91:12:C1:FF:C6:68:00:29:4A:4E:8D

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
